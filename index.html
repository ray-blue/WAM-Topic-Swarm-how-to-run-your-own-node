                We Are Millions  Hackerthon Operators Day.  Operators day was a session dedicated to learning how  to become a node operator 
                and how to make hardware work for you. We had five informative workshops that provided the necessary resources, research and 
                information to get anybody familiar with Node`s. There are links to all the record sessions below from different Startups.

            <h3>Talk & Workshop 1  Run your Bee node</h3>
            <p>
                In this talk, the Swarm team will explain how the Swarm network works, what part nodes play in it and how to spin up your own node. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Workshop 2  how to set up your Fluence node</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://fluence.network/">Fluence</a> provides an open-source, permissionless, decentralized platform and a development toolkit for building, 
                hosting, and running peer-to-peer applications and protocols. The Fluence team will take you through the steps 
                of setting up your own Fluence node.
            </p>

            <h3>Workshop 3 How to run a NYM node</h3>
            <p>
                
                Learn directly from the <a href="https://nymtech.net/">NYM</a> team how to become a node operator in their network. NYM runs a multi-layered network called a mixnet. 
                In each layer of the mixnet, mix nodes mix your internet traffic with that of other users, making communications private and hiding 
                your metadata.
            </p>

            <h3>Workshop 4 Avado demo: running a Swarm data node</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://ava.do/">Avado</a> provides specialized HW and SW that allows you to easily run and manage different network nodes. 
                This workshop will demonstrate how to run a Swarm node on Avado.
            </p>

            <h3>Panel discussion; Hosting distributed networks - Relevance and Impact</h3>
            <p>
                Distributed networks were created with the purpose to remediate the shortcomings of centralised networks of Web2. 
                In his talk, Denis Roio will unpack what distributed networks are and why they matter. The talk will be held 
                via <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1BRKjnEbPzZKw">Twitter Spaces.</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <p> My focus though will be on how to run your Bee node and what its about. Anatol talked us through the swarm project and presented the demo. </p>
        
        <br>

        <div>
            <h2>Why would someone want a node?</h2>
            <p>
                Becoming a Bee client means you can be up and running in no time, it instantly exposes you to the ecosystem were you can begin to connect with peers all over the 
                world and become apart of Swarm.Which is a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the worlds 
                data onto Swarm.This new network has been built to be painless and user friendly. You can also join the swarm with no Ethereum backend and no Crypto onboarding.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Light Node(Full Node)</h3>
            <p>
                The Bee runs as a light node which is chain enabled. However, to fully engage in the swarm you need to set it to full-node. Being in full mode means
                you have access to the network and can easily upload and download files. But before you can do that you need to follow a few steps:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fund your node’s wallet with BZZ.</li>
                    <li>Purchase a batch of stamps with your BZZ.</li>
                    <li>Wait for the batch to propagate into the network.</li>
                    <li>Upload your content, specify the batch id so that  Bee can attach stamps to your chunks</li>
                    <li>Download your content using your contents hash.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Ultra light Node</h3>
            <p>
                Ultra light allows for the Bee to operate in a chain-less mode. This means you have access to the network but can not participate in most 
                of the activities such as storing chunks, forwarding or uploads. The only activity you can participate in is downloading files.
                <br>
                The upside is that onboarding is easier,and you can somewhat still use the node. Furthermore you can enjoy the benefit of free riding.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Bee Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
                The Dashboard is still under development. However, the idea around the Bee Dashboard is to monitor your transactions 
                of cheques as they accumulate,withdraw BZZ and many more features are under development and are coming soon.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>What Hardware can be used?</h3>
            <p>
                Ultra light node A Raspberry Pi 4  and a Smartphone can be used.
                Light node(Full Node), Any computer that's connected to the internet can be used 
                as well as cloud hosting and a Raspberry PI.
            </p>

            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Overlay verification process, A valid overlay address is required.</li>
                    <li>The amount of downloads are yet to be determined.</li>
                    <li>How much memory consumption is used and need, is still to be tested.</li>
                    <li>Bandwidth.</li>
                    <li>How?, and why do you get blocked, and for how long.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>All you need to get started</h4>
            <p>
                Bee is packaged for MacOS and Ubuntu, Raspbian, Debian and CentOS based Linux distributions.
                If your system is not supported, please see the <a href="https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/manual">manual installation</a>  
                section for information on how to install Bee.

                To install Bee you will need to go through the following process.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set up the external signer for Bee, Bee Clef. (Recommended)</li>
                <li>Install Bee and set it up to run as a service.</li>
                <li>Configure Bee.</li>
                <li>Fund your node with XDAI and BZZ for the mainnet and gETH and gBZZ for our testnet.</li>
                <li>Wait for your cheque book transactions to complete and batch store to update.</li>
                <li>Check Bee is working.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of swarm is to store data, and be in control of what you own. Web3 development is definitely 
                a leap forward and a completely new future for all. The main principle is that it will be decentralized rather than controlled by 
                governments and corporations, as is the case with today`s internet and, to some extent, connected to the concept of the “metaverse." 
                These are really exciting times ahead and I can not wait to use the complete version of this project.
